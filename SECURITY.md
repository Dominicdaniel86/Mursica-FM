| Older   | ❌ (No support)    |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **do not publicly disclose** security vulnerabilities (e.g., in a GitHub Issue). Instead, follow the instructions below for responsible disclosure:

1. **Email Dominic Krämer**  
   - Send an email to [Dominicdaniel3107@gmail.com] describing the nature of the vulnerability. Include steps to reproduce (if applicable) and any other relevant details.

2. **Response Time**  
   - We will acknowledge receipt of your email within **2–5 business days** whenever possible.  
   - We will investigate the issue as soon as we can and provide updates regarding the status and resolution.

3. **Resolution**  
   - Once the vulnerability is validated and a fix is ready, we’ll release any necessary patches or updates on the main branch of MursicaFM.  
   - We may publicly disclose the vulnerability after a fix has been deployed, giving credit to anyone who reported it responsibly (if they wish to be acknowledged).

## Scope & Guidelines

- **Scope**: This policy covers potential security vulnerabilities discovered in MursicaFM’s source code, Docker setup, or any related services that the project directly manages.  
- **Third-Party Services**: MursicaFM uses Spotify’s API under their license. Vulnerabilities related to Spotify’s infrastructure or API are **outside** our direct control and should be reported to Spotify.  
- **Responsible Disclosure**: We request that you share vulnerability details **privately** to minimize potential harm. If you believe an issue you’ve found could harm other users, or if it’s unclear whether it’s a security concern, please err on the side of caution and contact us by email.

## No Bug Bounty Program

At this time, MursicaFM **does not** offer a paid bug bounty program. We still appreciate reports and will attribute credit as appropriate.
