# Mursica FM

**Revolutionize your party with this third-party Spotify app, which makes listening to music as a group more seamless and interactive.** This app democratizes song selection, allowing participants to contribute their favorite tracks effortlessly. Only the host needs a Spotify account - everyone else can join freely to add some tracks! Its user-friendly interface keeps things simple, so you can focus on what really matters: the music. Best of all, it's free to use and accessible directly through your web browser. No installation required!
