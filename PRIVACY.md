## **Privacy Policy**

**Effective Date:** April 1, 2025
**Last Updated:** April 1, 2025

Welcome to **MursicaFM** (“**we**,” “**us**” or “**our**”). We’re committed to protecting your privacy when you use our website [https://mursica.fm](https://mursica.fm) (the “**Site**”) and related services (the “**Services**”).

This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, share, and protect the information you provide to us when you use **MursicaFM**. By accessing or using our Services, you agree to the collection and use of your information in accordance with this policy. If you do not agree, please do not use our Services.

### 1. Information We Collect

#### 1.1 **Hosting Users**

1. **Account Registration:**  
   - When you register for a MursicaFM hosting account, we collect your chosen username and email address, which are stored in plain text. Your password is stored securely using modern hashing functions and is never stored in plain text.  
2. **Spotify Premium Account Required:**  
   - To create a music party and host a session, you must log in with a **Spotify Premium** account. We do not directly access your Spotify credentials. Instead, we receive an authentication token from Spotify, which we store and refresh on our servers to make Spotify API calls on your behalf (e.g., play, pause, skip tracks).  
3. **Session Cookies:**  
   - We use cookies or similar technologies to store a session token for authentication purposes on our platform. This helps us keep you logged in and associate your actions with your hosting account.

#### 1.2 **Joining Members (Non-Hosting Users)**

- **User Name & Session Association:**  
  - When you join a party created by a hosting user, you may provide a custom user name. We store this user name alongside the session you joined. We do not require or process any Spotify credentials for joining members, unless they later decide to host their own session (at which point a Premium account is needed).

### 2. How We Use Your Information

- **To Provide the Services:** We use your account information (hosting users) and session data to let you create or join a music party, control Spotify playback, and display real-time updates about the music session.
- **Authentication & Security:** Cookies and session tokens are used to verify your identity, protect your account from unauthorized access, and keep you logged in.
- **Spotify Playback Control:** We use your stored Spotify OAuth token exclusively for making authorized Spotify API calls on your behalf (e.g., play, pause, skip).
- **Service Improvements:** We may use anonymized or aggregated data to improve our Services (e.g., ensuring our platform runs smoothly and securely).

---

### 3. Data Sharing & Disclosure

- **Third Parties:** We do not share your personal data with third parties for marketing or advertising. We only share data as necessary to provide our Services (e.g., communicating with Spotify’s API).
- **Legal Compliance:** We may disclose your data to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request.

---

### 4. Data Retention & Security

- **Retention:** We store your account data (username, email, hashed password) and any tokens associated with your Spotify login for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you the Services.
- **Security Measures:** We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data against unauthorized access, accidental loss, destruction, or damage. For example, passwords are hashed, and access to our systems is restricted to authorized personnel.

### 5. Cookies & Tracking Technologies

- **What Are Cookies?**
  - Cookies are small text files placed on your device to help us recognize you, maintain your login session, and provide certain functionalities.
- **Types of Cookies We Use:**  
  - **Session Cookies:** These keep you logged in during your visit. They expire when you close your browser.  
  - **Authentication Tokens:** These allow our backend to verify your identity after login.
- **How to Manage Cookies:**  
  - Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can modify your browser settings to decline cookies if you prefer. However, doing so may affect certain functionalities of **MursicaFM**.
